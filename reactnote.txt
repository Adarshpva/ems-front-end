   4. Two Way binding         one way binding       two way binding

   6. state : used to store data, and share it other component(parent to child)
         - create a stste using usestate
      const[state-name, function name to charge state value] = useState(initial-value)
         -to update state : using state upadate function where pass the update value as argument
         - to share state from parent to child : using props

   

   7. components: 2 types of component (create a js file with file name start with capital letter)
         - class based component / stateful component : 
         - functional based component  / stateless component :

   8. React Hooks
        -useState(): to create user defined state  in functioal component
        -useEffect(): allow you to perform side efect in our component. if a component change another also chage
        - useParams(): get path parameter from route associate with a component.
        - useNavigate(): used to redirect from one page to another
        -useDispatch(): dispatch by component
        -useSelector(): selected updated state from store to component
        -useContext():that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component



   9. conditional rendering
   10. path set up for component 
     -- package contains bindings for using React Router in web applications. - react-router-dom
     -- to route all app routes - browser router
    -- create path for more items  - Routes
    -- create path for 1 component  - route
    - Link: used to redirect from one pagge to aother
    -useParams : get path parameter from route associate with a component
   11. REDUX: state mangement in react
       - to avoid props drilling(passing propes to inner child)
        -basic
          - store: global
              -provide store to app
          - action: define logic to update state 
              - it should dispatch by component using useDispatch hook
          - reducer: update state
          -component: select updated state from store using useSelector hook

   12. REDUX TOOLKIT: standard way to write redux logic  
           - install toolkit
           -store
           -createSlice: we can both reducer and action 
   13. component Life Cycle
           -Mounting: when component added to dom
           -updating: when state/props updated in component
           -unMounting: component id removed from the dom
    14. Context api: avoid props drilling ,share data between components
           -create context:
                - create state i the context and provide it into all children
           - use context: to access the context in a component
